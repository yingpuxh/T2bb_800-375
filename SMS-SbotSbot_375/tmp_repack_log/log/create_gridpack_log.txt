 4 Decay particles with the MadSpin module:                         madspin=OFF
 5 Add weights to the events based on changing model parameters:   reweight=OFF
  Either type the switch number (1 to 5) to change its default setting,
  or set any switch explicitly (e.g. type 'madspin=ON' at the prompt)
  Type '0', 'auto', 'done' or just press enter when you are done.
